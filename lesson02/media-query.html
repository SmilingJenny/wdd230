            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I
                know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them
                that they may
                accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Mosiah 4:27</h2>
            <p>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run
                faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he
                might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</p>
